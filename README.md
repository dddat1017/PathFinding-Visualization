# PathFinding Visualization

### About
FIND THE SHORTEST PATH FROM A 'STARTING' CELL TO AN 'EXIT' CELL USING THE BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH (BFS) ALGORITHM. THIS IMPLEMENTATION UTLIZED A QUEUE TO TRAVERSE THROUGH ALL THE POSSIBLE "NODES", OR CELLS, FROM THE START TO THE EXIT. THE GOAL IS TO FIND A PATH WITH THE LEAST NUMBER OF STEPS (A STEP BEING A CELL IN ANY DIRECTION N,S,W,E,NW,NE,SW,SE), NOT THE "SHORTEST DISTANCE".
